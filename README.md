# OpenBills Web

Frontend for a libre billing software written in react. OpenBills is geared towards small businesses and is highly biased with my workflow.
There are some innovative features that make generating invoices more convinient, and automates some of the data entry. The defaults are highly biased towards my own workflow but I'm open to suggestions. 

Currently, there are no installation instructions because I'm not releasing the binaries right now. 
To test, clone this repo and also <https://github.com/MikunoNaka/OpenBills-server>, 
in `openbills-web` directory, do `yarn start` or `npm run start`, and in `OpenBills-server` do `go run .` to start the development version.
